<h1>Welcome section</h1>
	<h2>Greetings everyone, my name is Kayla Greene and welcome to my website. The purpose of this site is to let you all know a little bit about me including my interests.</h2>
<h3>Class Section</h3>	
	<section>My major is New Media Technology in the Digital Journalism track. I have taken Intro in New Media in the fall semester and that class taught me about the Adobe life. I have also enjoyed English 101 and Eglish 102 courses because it involves writing which is required for my major. I used to not like English until I went to college. Surprisingly, English is now one of my best subjects. </section>

<h6>Biography about myself</h6>
	<section>I am a 20 year female who is born and raised in The Bronx New York. I currently live there now. I live in a single parent household and I am my mom's only child. I have two younger brothers on my dad's side. I came to study at LaGuardia Community College because I wanted to be around different kind of people. I was originally enrolled in Medgar Evers College but I did not like the energy that the school gives off. I transfered to LaGuardia Community College beause I have a story to tell and the school is very diverse. That means I can learn different people's stories and struggles and how they over came those struggles.</section>
